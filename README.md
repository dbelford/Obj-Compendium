# Compendium



A compilation of Obj-C snippets, classes and frameworks for accomplishing common tasks in OSX & iOS applications.  Heavily inspired by Bootstrap's documentation.  This is not a framework in itself though.

You can use the compendium as a starting point to discover useful classes for issues not solved or implemented by Apple's various frameworks.  Or use it as a jumping off point for getting to popular open source Obj-C classes and frameworks hosted on Github.
